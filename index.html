<!-- you can reference files like game-logo.png directly in your index.html or any other files using a relative path (/game-logo.png), since the server knows that anything in public is served from the root URL. -->
 <!-- For any assets placed in src (like inside a components folder), you'd need to import them in your components and reference them using something like import logo from './game-logo.png';. -->
  <!-- If you try loading localhost:5173/game-logo.png, you'll be able to see that image -->

   <!--* Which Folder Should You Use?
You should use the public/ folder for any images that should not be handled by the build process and that should be generally available. Good candidates are images used directly in the index.html file or favicons.
On the other hand, images that are used inside of components should typically be stored in the src/ folder (e.g., in src/assets/). -->
